If you played "Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories" in a Playstation and you have an iOS device, you're probably going to love this project. It's a full remake of the game, with many additions and duelists based in the anime, instead of the game dueslists.

Instead of putting many cards costing 999999 like the original game did, there an algorithm that generates the card prize based on its attack and defense (except the Exodia cards, they still have that price). The game also include many new cards; some based in the real trading card game and some based in anime exclusive cards, which might make the game more insteresting, since there will be new cards in every corner of the game.

The project its still in pre-alpha, since the code still doesn't had a refactor and the duel system isn't functional, but it's already capable of saving the game, organizing the deck, buying cards and create a new save. The free duel screen is also almost finished, but still need a new texture and new duelist icons.

So, let's use Monster Reborn and bring this amazing game back?
